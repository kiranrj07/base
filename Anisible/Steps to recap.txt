sudo apt install ansible -y

Install sshpass package
#sudo apt-get install sshpass -y

Step 1: Default direcotry for inventory is: cd /etc/ansible and it contains

ansible.cfg    [uncomment below section]
[defaults]
host_key_checking = false

hosts [This is the default directory]    [Add below line and check for pinging]
192.168.0.106 ansible_ssh_pass=root@123 ansible_ssh_user=master

To run ansible with respect to hosts file [Default inventory file]
ansible 192.168.0.106 -m ping  [-m stands for modules]

To run ansible with respect to custom inventory file
ansible [host,group,group_of_group] -m ping -i inventory_filename

To run ansible with respect to Playbook
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i /home/user5/ansible/inventory/inventory.txt\

To run ansible with respect to module
ansible-playbook [playbook.yml]    [Here we and not mentioning inventory hence default /etc/ansible/hosts is looked]
