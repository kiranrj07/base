is eve-ng running on dockers containers
no  its running on ubuntu
dockers is a side tool that you can use
ok.

i also face issue like, node not starting up with start up config,
when working as users preiviliage, it happens in random? y

you're using old Eve
the current version of Eve is 3.x you are on 2.x
hmm ok ok, hope ugrading wont crash our labs becasue labs are going to be deployed after 3 days ?
hopefully not
here's what we are going to do
I will upgrade to the last 2.x and you test your labs and remove the lab
you dont need, then I will leave, you deploy your labs later, after 3-4 days
you come back I will upgrade it to 3.x 

sounds good but your not upgrading it now ?
minor upgrade
ok. ok 
we are using 2 eve-ng pro so i may have to upgradge that as well
when you do the upgrade accept the defaults
try now
ok


Thank you. 
really appreciated.

wait just so you know I didnt upgrade to the latest 2.x
and I wont until you deploy your labs later

on your other Eve vm
do this 
apt update
apt upgrade
apt autoremove
accept the defaults
check your labs

look fine.
ok good 
deploy them in 3 days , backup your images and labs
and come back we will do major upgrades, it will take time
please make sure your internet is fast as it is now
it will be very big
yes noted, Thanks again. really helpful.
You're Welcome :)
bye now
